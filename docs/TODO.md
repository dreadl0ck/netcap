# TODOs

- DBs: add country blocklists: "did a user browse a flagged website?"
  - http://netzsperre.liwest.at
- DBs: https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog
  - would require to retrieve IOCs for a CVE id, maybe via greynoise.io api?

- http host session duration:
  - how much time did a user spent on a specific host?
    - eg measure as duration between first and last http request to a host

Install ndpi on m1 mac:
  
  brew install ndpi

- ip and domain reputation
  - domain age: mark domains registered in the past 30 days
  - categorize domains (sector etc)
  - integrate feeds from https://threatview.io
- add config to apply extra asset info to audit records: eg employee workstations in internal network etc

- httptest stream to reproduce issue: tcp/world-wide-web-http/192.168.0.54-49412--80.239.217.161-80.bin
  - works: net capture -read http-reassembly-test.pcap -conns -debug -workers 1
  - update Fetch(length int) []byte
  - concurrency also breaks client-server detection in some cases...
  - use sequence numbers instead of timestamps for fragment ordering
  - repro:
    - net capture -read http-reassembly-test.pcap -workers 1
    - net capture -read http-reassembly-test.pcap -workers 12

## Notes

When switching sync.Mutex variables with the deadlock.Mutex variant for debugging,
the following can be used to fix the imports after applying the global find and replace:

    directories=$(go list -f {{.Dir}} ./...)
    test -z "`for dir in $directories; do goimports -w $dir/*.go | tee /dev/stderr; done`"
