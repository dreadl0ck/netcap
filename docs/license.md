# License

## GNU General Public License v3.0

Netcap is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3, which is a very permissive open source license, that allows others to do almost anything they want with the project, except to distribute closed source versions.

Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights.

This license type was chosen with Netcaps research purpose in mind, and in the hope that it leads to further improvements and new capabilities contributed by other researchers on the long term.

## Usage Disclaimer

Netcap was developed in a short timeframe as a research project and thus was neither tested nor developed to run in a production environment. The project may contain bugs, that have not yet been discovered. Error handling is not very graceful, in many cases that could have been handled otherwise, the program panics in order to assist in debugging with a stack trace. Until there are further unit tests and the error handling is more robust, using Netcap for other purposes than research is not recommended!
